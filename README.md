# Unofficial-ConneXus-Web
Am currently a member of ConneXus Percussion and thought it would be fun to copy, gut, and rebuild the website. Truely some of my best HTML and CSS handy work as well as my first go at attaching JavaScript to a build. Theres a lot here so it might be a while till I put even the smallest parts of it up.
