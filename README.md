# Unofficial-ConneXus-Web
I am currently a member of ConneXus Percussion and thought it would be fun to copy, gut, and rebuild the website. Truely some of my best HTML and CSS handy work as well as my first go at attaching JavaScript to a website build. Theres a lot here, and it just keeps growing!
